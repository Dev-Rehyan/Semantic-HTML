## Description
In this project I have been adapt a websites HTML so that it meets accessibility standards. This was achieved by making sure that -

- Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code.
- HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
- Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes.
- Heading attributes fall in sequential order.
- Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title.

I updated HTML and CSS codes for a user friendly accessible webite.

## Resources
- Semantic HTML
- Image Alt Attributes
